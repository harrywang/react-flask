## Setup

Install the followings:

Node.js: The JavaScript runtime that you will use to run your frontend project.
Yarn: A package and project manager for Node.js applications.
Python: A recent Python 3 interpreter to run the Flask backend on.

React frontend:

```
$ npx create-react-app react-frontend
$ cd react-frontend
$ yarn start
```

Note: I ran into this problem: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8086 and solved it by `npm uninstall -g create-react-app`
